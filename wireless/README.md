# Wireless buzzer

Firmware for a battery-powered buzzer on an [Adafruit ESP32 Feather V2](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5400). It
talks to the BuzzerBox's game server over the box's WiFi, and the box shows it to the game master like its own buzzers
(as "Funkbuzzer" with the end of its MAC address).

## How it behaves

- **Asleep** until its button is pressed. That press only wakes it up; it doesn't buzz.
- **Awake**, it connects to the box's WiFi and game server. The first connection after a power-up scans for the box
  (a few seconds), later ones go straight to the box's channel.
- It **stays awake while a game is running** on the box (also while the game master's device is away).
- **Without a game** it goes back to sleep 10 minutes after the last press. It also goes to sleep when it can't reach
  the box within 30 s of waking, or loses it for a minute.
- **Plugged into the box over USB**, the box gives it its WiFi name and password and its address. The box wakes it up
  for that (through the reset line), so a sleeping buzzer works too; the NeoPixel flashes green three times when it got
  them. The USB cable also charges the battery.

## Lights

The NeoPixel on the Feather shows the status; the light (`LIGHT_PIN`, the Feather's red LED or an arcade button's lamp)
is for the players.

| Status | NeoPixel | Light |
|---|---|---|
| Connecting | blue, blinking | off |
| No WiFi yet: plug it into the box | magenta, blinking | off |
| Lost the box, trying again | yellow, blinking | off |
| Connected, no game | cyan, short blink every 2 s | off |
| Game, buzzers free | green | on |
| Game, another team buzzed | dim red | off |
| Game, **this team buzzed** | white, flashing | flashing |
| Got the WiFi over USB | green, 3 flashes | |
| Got invalid WiFi settings | red, 3 flashes | |

A low battery (below 3.5 V) adds a short orange blink every 5 s, and the game master sees a battery icon next to the
buzzer.

## Hardware

| Part | Pin |
|---|---|
| Button | GPIO 38, the Feather's user button, not reset (`BUTTON_PIN`) |
| Big button | GPIO 27 (A10) to GND (`EXTERNAL_BUTTON_PIN`); either button buzzes and wakes the buzzer |
| Light | GPIO 13, the Feather's red LED (`LIGHT_PIN`) |
| NeoPixel | GPIO 0, powered through GPIO 2 (off while asleep) |
| Battery voltage | GPIO 35 (A13), halved by the Feather's divider |
| Battery | a 3.7 V LiPo on the JST connector |

Both buttons work at the same time, so the Feather's own button stays handy for testing. The big button needs no
resistor: GPIO 27 gets the internal pull-up, also while asleep. It can go on another RTC GPIO (`EXTERNAL_BUTTON_PIN` in
`include/config.h`): 4, 14, 25-27, 32 or 33. Avoid 12 and 15, which decide how the ESP32 starts, and 34-39, which
would need a pull-up resistor. `GPIO_NUM_NC` turns the big button off. The lamp of an arcade button usually needs more
current or voltage than a GPIO gives, so switch it with a transistor on `LIGHT_PIN`.

## Building and flashing

With [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), from this directory:

```bash
pio run                              # build
pio run --target upload              # flash over USB
pio device monitor                   # serial log at 115200 baud
pio test -e native                   # tests of lib/buzzer_core on this computer
```

## Protocol

JSON over UDP with the game server (BuzzUI `server/services/udp-buzzer.service.ts`, port 5005; the buzzer listens on
5006):

| Direction | Packet |
|---|---|
| buzzer → server, every second | `{"t":"HB","id":<MAC>,"lp":5006,"seq":<n>,"bat":<mV>,"fw":<version>}` |
| buzzer → server | `{"t":"PRESS","id":<MAC>,"n":<press number>,"ts":<µs on the server's clock>}` |
| server → buzzer | `{"t":"STATE","selected":…,"locked":…,"game":…,"st":<server µs>,"ack":<seq>,"pa":<n>}` |

The server answers every heartbeat (`ack`) and every press (`pa`), and sends a `STATE` whenever the lock or the marked
team changes. A press is sent again every 30 ms until it is acknowledged; the server takes each press number once.

Presses that arrive within 50 ms of each other are compared by `ts`. The buzzer follows the server's clock (`st`) from
the heartbeat answers, as NTP does: the sample with the shortest round trip wins (`lib/buzzer_core/clock_sync.*`). So a
press that took longer over the WiFi still wins if it was first.

USB, text lines at 115200 baud (BuzzUI `server/services/buzzer-provisioning.service.ts`):

```
box → buzzer   BUZZ HELLO
buzzer → box   BUZZ READY <MAC> <firmware version>        (also when it starts)
box → buzzer   BUZZ WIFI {"ssid":…,"pass":…,"host":…,"port":…}
buzzer → box   BUZZ OK | BUZZ ERROR <reason>
```

The buzzer only uses the serial connection while USB is plugged in. Without USB the Feather's USB serial chip
(CH9102) has no power, and an ESP32 that kept its serial output (TX) high would power it halfway through that line: the
chip then didn't show up on the computer when USB was plugged in, as long as the buzzer was awake on its battery. So the
ESP32 leaves TX alone until it sees the chip's output (its RX, GPIO 3) high, and lets go of it again when RX stays low.

The settings are kept in the flash (`Preferences`, namespace `buzzer`). To give a buzzer another network by hand, e.g.
for a dev server on your computer, send those lines in a serial terminal.

## Code

- `src/main.cpp` — setup and loop: WiFi, UDP, USB, sleep
- `src/button.*` — a button: the interrupt takes the time of the press, `poll()` debounces it
- `src/usb_link.*` — serial over USB, only while USB is plugged in (see below)
- `src/indicator.*` — the NeoPixel and the light
- `include/config.h` — pins and timings
- `lib/buzzer_core/` — the logic without hardware, tested natively: `clock_sync` (the server's clock), `power_policy`
  (when to sleep) and `messages` (the JSON packets)
